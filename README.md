### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

  The topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment. At first, I felt unprepared to create a popup. But after some research, I realized that I already possessed the basic building blocks and JavaScript knowledge needed to complete this stretch feature.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
  If I had more time, I would add more styling to the ui and to the buttons on the website.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

  Regarding my project demo, during the first few takes, most of my features worked as intended. While recording, I noticed that I did not set a default image for my backdrop image in the popups. I added this feature before recording my final take. I noticed that some of my peers added a nav bar to their websites; This is something I would like to implement in the future.
